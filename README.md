# SpamTester

Tanzania faces an escalating issue with scam and spam SMS, particularly targeting users of mobile money services such as Tigo-Pesa, M-Pesa, and Airtel Money. Fraudsters send deceptive SMS messages to trick individuals into divulging their PINs or transferring money, often preying on the elderly, rural populations, and those with limited technical knowledge. These scams compromise user confidentiality, integrity, and availability of mobile accounts.

This issue impacts not just individuals but also mobile money operators, banks, and the government, undermining trust and the adoption of digital finance.

To address this, our project aims to develop an AI-driven SMS spam detector using a binary classification model trained on 5,000 English SMS samples. The tool will be accessible via a secure, anonymous website hosted on AWS. We are also considering a future SMS-based version for users with limited internet access.

The project is currently under development and will be deployed soon.
